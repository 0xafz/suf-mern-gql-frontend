> Here's [backend repo](https://github.com/zkindest/suf-mern-gql-backend)

**Update 1:** This project is a fork from [amand33p](https://github.com/amand33p). I have been making some efforts to replace `material-ui` with `twin.macro` just to learn react, CSS and make reusable components. It's hard to get it all correct (flexibility,ease of use, performance)

**Update 2:** Migrated Server codebase to **Typescript** using `type-graphql`, `typegoose`.

**Update 3:** Migrated Client codebase to **Typescript** using `graphql`, `@graphql-codegen` 💚 ,`definitelyTyped` libs.

**Update 4: (27/10/2021)** Automated Graphql Testing using `jest`, `ts-jest`, `isomorphic-fetch`.

**Update 5: (29/10/2021)** Replaced constant growing arrays with mongoose virtuals.

**Update 6: 03/05/2022** Make code clean and refactors, and use Poly repos.

## Future

1. <strike>Automate Graphql Testing</strike> ✔️
2. <strike>Replace constant growing arrays in schema as mongoose document sizelimit is **16MB** </strike>. ✔️
3. Use transactions in mutation resolvers which involves multiple mutating db requests.
4. Add Dark Mode.

## Usage

#### web:

Open `.packages/web/src/constants` & change `backendUrl` variable to `"http://localhost:4000"`
