# Stack Underflow | SOF Clone | MERN-GraphQL

**Update 1:** This project is a fork from [amand33p](https://github.com/amand33p). I have been making some efforts to replace `material-ui` with `twin.macro` just to learn react, CSS and make reusable components myself. It's been a great journey so far and I learned a lot from `material-ui`, they did solid work with their lib and also used a tonne of `useRef` ðŸ˜… to opt-out of react default rendering  behaviour.

**Update 2:** Migrated Server codebase to **Typescript** using `type-graphql`, `typegoose`.

**Update 3:** Migrated Client codebase to **Typescript** using `graphql`, `@graphql-codegen` ðŸ’š ,`definitelyTyped` libs.

## Future
1. Replace constant growing arrays in schema as mongoose document sizelimit is **16MB**.
2. Use transactions in mutation resolvers which involves multiple db operations.
3. Add Dark Mode.

## Usage

#### Env variable:

Create a .env file in server directory and add the following:

```
MONGODB_URI = "Your Mongo URI"
PORT = 4000
SECRET = "Your JWT secret"

```

#### Client:

Open client/src/backendUrl.js & change "backend" variable to `"http://localhost:4000"`

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

#### Server:

Note: Make sure that you have installed 'nodemon' as global package.

```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```
